# PasswordStrengthMeter
A password checker which determines the quality and strength of your password based on multiple criterion. 

## Design
The password checker will have the ability to analyse a password it gets as input and determine the quality and strength of the password accroding to a range of criteria.

**Criteria:**
1. Contain at least one upper-case letter. 
2. Contain at least one lower-case letter. 
3. Contain at least one numeric character. 
4. Contain at least one symbol/punctual character. 
5. Have a minimal length of 10 characters. 

Based on the criteria listed above, the application will comment on the strength of the password. It will also receive an overall password strength rating. 

## Implementation

To begin with, the password analysis and strength checker will have command-line functionality. I intend on developing the password strength meter further to have improved functionality.
